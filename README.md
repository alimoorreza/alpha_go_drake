First, train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn how to move a piece (black or white) in a 19x19 Go board through supervised learning on a dataset of human gameplay replays. This CNN, acting as the bootstrapping mechanism, will initialize the policy network that will then continue training via reinforcement learning.
